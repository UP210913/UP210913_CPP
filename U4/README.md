# **2-Things of consider**  🤔
*>One player: The player will go first and then the intelligence assuming that the player will be "0" and the CPU "X".*

*>Vs someone: The machine recognizes that player one gets "0" and player two gets "X".*

## Possible mistake  😨
*This program may have some flaws since there will always be some vulnerability.
1-This can be returned in an infinite loop if a number with decimal is entered or also if a letter is entered.
2-If it moves in the slightest it can move from place or enter unwanted values.*

# **4-Code and explanation**  🤷

*In this code too many lines of text were used since it had too many flaws which had to be covered.
In it, the table of the cat was printed giving numbers to each box from 1 to 9 so that each player selects the box that is most convenient for him.
The program gave you to choose player 1 with the "0" and player 2 with "X". When you play against the machine it is automatically assigned the "X" and the player the "0". At the end the winning player is printed.*

*Here we are choosing whether to play with the machine or with a friend, in this case it is against the CPU in which we will choose the first option.*

*Well, here is the representation of how I lost against the machine and where my assigned player was the "0".*

*In this case we are playing with a friend where the second option will be selected as printed in the program so that player one is "0" and player two is "X".*

*Lastly, we have that the winner was player 1 where this is implicitly made to the last of the table.*
