*RECOMENDATION*

This program is used to play individual naval battle where when you run you start with a program welcome that lasts a few seconds, then it displays 2 options where 1 is to start the game and 2 is the rules of the game. When you start the game you get to choose the difficulty. then it asks you for the orientation as well as the coordinates of all the boats where to choose the orientation it is only h or v, for horizontal or vertical respectively and in the coordinates put the separate numbers. To find out if the hit hits an H but instead an asterisk.

## Possible mistake  üò®
*Errors can occur in this program when letters are used in the coordinates.*
*Putting numbers together generates errors or putting numbers in the orientation of the ships.*

# **5-Ending**  üéì
*In this program we literally struggled a lot but we were able to do it and we also had a lot of fun doing it, in which our practices from the entire quarter were put into practice to develop said game.*
