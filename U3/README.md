## Instructions for use and recommendations

### To run the program

If you are working on Linux, you have to type "/." followed by the file name, in the terminal in Visual Studio. If you are working in Windows, you have to run the .exe file.

### Instructions and recommendations

When you run the code, avoid putting decimal numbers, this causes the program to bug. At first choose the game mode using the numbers it shows you.

Then it shows you the board with the number of positions you can choose. Choose one and depending on the game mode, it will be the turn of the PC or the 2nd player.

In case you choose an occupied square, the program will ask you to another position.

The game ends when one player wins or when the positions on the board run out.

*a) When Player 1 won*

## Flowchart

Now, you will see a flowchart of the Tic Tac Toe Game. It was made in a web page using the functions used in the code.

## Development and explanation

This program was developed and created in Visual Studio Code. Many tests were made to observe and correct execution or code errors. With the execution tests, ideas were also thought to improve the aesthestics of the game, improvements in the process of the games, and how the texts of the program are printed.
Now you can see examples of situations whit the code running. Here, you can see the possible results you can get.

## Conclusion

To end, a conclusion will be given about of the game code, the complications that occurred in the process and making possible the situations that may exist in the game. From my point of view, the most difficult part of the code was making the artificial intelligence, complicated on the one hand and very slow on the other. The result was as expected and the objective was met. In terms of aesthetics, it was also very good in terms of color alone, graphically not much attention is still paid. It only remains to hope that they like it. Thanks for your attention.
